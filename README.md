### What is this repository for? ###

* Version
0.0.1

* Quick summary:
We will create a 1v1 fighter game, inspired by Brawl. 
In our game, each player can use a standard melee attack and a standard projectile attack.
Various characters will have different abilities, which are accessed by using combo attacks (direction+primary/secondary attack). 
Each character will have a skin which changes dynamically during the game, to reflect the inner state of the character. 
For example, after doing a melee attack, the character changes to a blue color, after doing a projectile attack, the character changes to a red color, and combos will turn the character into any number of other colors.
This will make gameplay a visually unique experience.
